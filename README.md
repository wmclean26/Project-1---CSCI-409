# Project-1---CSCI-409

Project Proposal: Use a game as the face for a trojanized file that contains "ransomeware", but realistically is a keylogger.

Steps:
  - Download an acutal game to play, but while the game is midway through the first mission, a ransomeware message pops up.
  - The ransomeware is a long list of things to do in order to gain access to the computer back. In the list of things to do, DO NOT TURN OFF THE COMPUTER, is in the list. The ransomeware is just a cover for a keylogger to latch onto the registry. 
  - If the computer is restarted or turned off, the keylogger will still be present and able to intercept the username and password or the user.
  - If they go through with the ransomeware, then I will not only get the money, but I will still be on the system.
  - If they choose to do nothing and wait it out, the computer will automatically restart after a certain amount of time.
